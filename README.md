# Number Guessing Game  
[Watch the demo](https://github.com/cris-mbici/binary-search-game/blob/main/binary_guesser.mp4)
. This is a simple number-guessing game where you choose a lower and upper limit, and the game randomly selects a number within that range. Your goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. The game calculates the ideal number of guesses using the binary search strategy, helping you optimize your approach.  

After setting the range, you start guessing, and the game provides feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low. The objective is to find the number while staying within the ideal guess count. If you exceed the recommended number of tries, the game will let you know.  

To play, run the script in Python and follow the prompts to enter a range and start guessing. The game keeps track of your attempts and lets you know if you managed to guess efficiently. Try to beat the ideal guess count by using strategy and logical thinking.
